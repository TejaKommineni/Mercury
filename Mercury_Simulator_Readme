# This is a Read me file for Mercury Simulator.

Mercury Simulator on a high level can do two things:
1) Add Vehicles to the System
2) Simulate Events

When you select the option of adding vehicles to the system.
It will display the number of vehicles that are present in the system and asks
for an input on number of vehicles user would like to add to the system.
On specifying the input. These vehicles get added to the system and they start
sending periodic reports every 10 seconds.

When the user selects an option to Simulate an event.Note this should be done 
only after adding vehicles to the system.
He will be given the option to simulate different types of events. He can choose 
one of the event type. After Chosing the event type the user has two options.
a)The user can look at the existing vehicles in the system and how they are 
clustered. This can help him know the distribution of the vehicles and a rough
estimate on which point to simulate the event. So, as to impact a threshold of
vehicles. He can also custom query the system to see number of vehicles in a
given region. Once the user chooses the impact region. He can input those to the
system to simulate the event.
b)The user can directly input the location at which he wants to issue the event
without looking at the vehicle distribution of the system.

At present either the reports or the events are just published to console. This
can be modified based on our usage model.
