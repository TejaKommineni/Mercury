Intelligent Transportation Systems require a communication conduit for
the agents in the ecosystem. A variety of safety- and consumer-service
messages are useful, even critical for coordinating the ongoing state
of mobile endpoints.  Communicating telemetry between these endpoints,
along with data from other devices in the environment, allows them to
work together and improve safety. Moreover, it is important for
centralized services to have a global view and provide information
based on this vantage point. To this end, we have developed \name,
an end-to-end messaging system with lightweight state overhead and
publish/subscribe functionality. \name is designed to flexibly
integrate into the mobile network environment under which it is deployed.
\name's centralized Broker allows for data aggregation services and
data analysis. The Adapter tunes to the particular network
environment, allowing Client Endpoints a pathway to
communicate. Concurrent processing and event-driven design are used to
minimize latency to meet demanding low-latency messaging requirements.
