\section{Conclusion}

We have presented Mercury, an end-to end mobility centric messaging
system that improves safety within the vehicular environment. We have
looked at the architecture and different components of Mercury. We
have discussed the different deployment scenarios and how Mercury can
fit in each of them. We also analyzed the need of a pubsub system in
this environment and our choice to use Kafka for the
implementation. We evaluated our prototype Mercury implementation in a
4G deployment context. A vehicle simulator was written to test
functional correctness, and a synthetic echo application was used to
evaluate rount trip time latency performance. We conclude that the
prototype is functionally accurate, but requires additional
parallelism and tuning to meet latency requirements for realistic
workloads. We have also considered how adding a direction based metric
to this system would make it more precise and how we can incorporate
more trust into Mercury so that it is not misused.
