\section{Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss evaluation approach.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Do evaluation in PhantomNet using OpenEPC with emulated RAN.
  \item Use vehicle mobility model, SUMO, to drive realistic mobility scenarios.
  \item Use SUMO output (position, primarily), to trigger handover.
  \end{itemize}
\item Types of evaluations to perform.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Functional: Endpoints connect and are tracked properly (handover).
  \item Functional: Areas of Interest are interpreted properly.
  \item Scaling: Run simulated/emulated scenarios with dozens of endpoints.
  \item Scaling: Increase message/sec load and observe system response times.
  \item Trust: Try to forge and alter messages (MITM)
  \item Trust: Try to manipulate system state (``i.e., game the system'').
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
