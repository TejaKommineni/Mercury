\section*{Implementation of Mercury}

\begin{itemize}
\item The messages/events - types, constraints (size), attributes, etc.
\item Mercury broker
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Areas of Interest
  \item Trust enforcement
  \item Peering (multiple brokers)
  \item Endpoint identification/tracking
  \end{itemize}
\item Pubsub service, including subscription and peering semantics
\item Mobile network messaging adapter
\item Unicast upstream transit
\item eMBMS downstream transit
\item Transparent interposition (a la SMORE)
\item UE/client mechanisms
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Design Goal Alignment}

The remainder of the design section of the paper is dedicated to a
deeper exploration of the design of Mercury and how it aligns with the
afforementioned goals.

\subsubsection{Delivering Relevant Content}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss what makes content relevant, and to whom it is relevent.
\item Metric(s) for relevancy?
\item Introduce and expand on Areas of Interest (dynamic grouping).
\item Motivate and describe publish/subscribe mechanism.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reliable Communication}

\begin{itemize}
\item Differing message requirements, based on type
\item Effects of latency, minimization through proximity to network edge
\item Delivery service levels (guaranteed, best effort)
\item Robust transit mechanisms?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Deployment Scenarios}

\begin{itemize}
\item Components/service designed to integrate into different deployments
\item Minimal cost/effort: pubsub/broker centrally located with PGWs
\item Incrementally closer: MTSO or metro-area (CloudRAN) deployment
\item At the edge: Deployed as a service running on eNodeBs
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Integrating Trust}

\begin{itemize}
\item PKI to prevent identity forgery
\item Message integrity codes to prevent tampering
\item Sequence numbers to prevent replay attacks
\item Centralized vetting by broker to detect bad behaviors/actors
\item Encryption for privacy? We should give this some thought.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technology Reuse and Integration}

\begin{itemize}
\item Composing from a good collection of parts
\item Existing pubsub, PKI, MAC/MIC, eMBMS mechanisms, SMORE
\item Working around limitations
\item Transparent interposition
\item Open possibilities in the 5G landscape
\end{itemize}
