\section{Related Work}

There has been plenty of attention paid to effecient and reliable
delivery of messages within VANETs.  Much of this focuses on multi-hop
clustering and hybrid use of evolved packet system RAN (LTE).  The
VMaSC~\cite{ucar2016multihop}, MDMAC~\cite{wolny2008modified}, and
NHop~\cite{zhang2011novel} systems attempt to form stable mobile
802.11p clusters, using the LTE network to bridge between disconnected
clusters. These systems are complimentary to Mercury in that they can
be used to reduce LTE resource contention and improve reliable
transfer of messages.

The MoPS~\cite{nasim2014mobile} publish-subscribe system scales
efficiently for large numbers of clients and deals well with changing
broker association.  Mercury could replace the \pubsub system used in
the prototype with MoPS to better target mobile endpoints. MoPS does
not include the area of interest concept, which would continue to be
handled by the Mercury broker. A paper by Pongthawornkamol et
al~\cite{pongthawornkamol2007analysis} looks at pubsub in the context
of ad hoc wireless networks, but only performs simulations of
mechanisms, and does not consider an end-to-end system.
