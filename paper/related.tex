There has been plenty of attention paid to effecient and reliable
delivery of messages within VANETs.  Much of this focuses on multi-hop
clustering and hybrid use of evolved packet system RAN (LTE).  The
VMaSC~\cite{VMaSC}, MDMAC~\cite{MDMAC}, and NHop~\cite{NHop} systems
attempt to form stable mobile 802.11p clusters, using the LTE network
to bridge between disconnected clusters. {\bf INSERT INFO ON CMGM.}
These systems are complimentary to Mercury in that they can be used to
reduce LTE resource contention and improve reliable transfer of
messages.

{\bf NEED MORE PUBSUB CITATIONS.}
The MoPS~\cite{MoPS} publish-subscribe system scales efficiently for
large numbers of clients and deals well with changing broker
association.  Mercury could replace the Emulab pubsub system used in
the prototype with MoPS to help it scale better. MoPS does not include
the area of interest concept, which would continue to be handled by
the Mercury broker.
