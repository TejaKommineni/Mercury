Runs showing RTT for an echo request/reply from echo app to Broker, and back.

Files are named as follows: run-N

Where 'N' is the rate (msgs/sec) sent.  In all cases, the test was set 
to send a factor of 10 messages over the rate. This nominally provides
10 seconds of data per run.

'run-baseline' is a baseline test with a rate of 1 message/sec run for 100 
seconds.

Note that somewhere between 500 and 750 msgs/sec, messages start to 
queue up, and delays for successive messages compound.  This indicates 
the need for more concurrency in message processing.
