File with some high level pointers, ideas, etc.  This info should be 
reorganized as the project progresses.  Just keeping it simple for the 
moment.

* Project name: Mercury

From Wikipedia:

In Roman mythology, Mercury is the patron god of financial gain, 
commerce, eloquence (and thus poetry), messages/communication (including 
divination), travelers, boundaries, luck, trickery and thieves.

* Possible pubsub candidate: The Emulab pubsub system

The git repo is here:

git@gitlab.flux.utah.edu:emulab/pubsub.git

or via https:

https://gitlab.flux.utah.edu/emulab/pubsub.git

It turns out that the examples I was thinking of are all in the Emulab 
code, and are more specific to the Elvin pubsub system (old pubsub used 
before this one).  This pubsub has wrappers for providing an Elvin-like 
interface, though I'm not sure those are of use to us.

Generally, I don't know the details of this pubsub system in great 
depth, but I know people we can talk to if the code here is not 
illuminating.

* Junguk provided a couple of pointers:

- Apple's iBeacon (potentially related technology):

https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/
https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/Getting-Started-with-iBeacon.pdf

- The mobile edge computing whitepaper.

I've checked this in to the repository.
