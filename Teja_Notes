I have seen the two following magazines having lot of work going on in this particular area. These will be a good reference to us.
a) IET Intelligent Transport Systems (journal)
b) IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine

This problem is on similar lines to what we are trying to solve:
Mobile Publish/Subscribe System for Intelligent Transport Systems over a Cloud Environment

The Geobroadcasting mentioned in this paper sounds interesting. Please, have a glance at it.
